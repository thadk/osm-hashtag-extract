In Marracuene District specifically, Peace Corps is supporting local counterparts in conducting epidemiological tracking of malarial cases to advocate need for stronger preventative measures, which an up-to-date base map plays an integral role. Malaria prevention and control remains a major U.S. foreign assistance objective and PMI's Strategy fully aligns with the U.S. Government's vision of ending preventable child and maternal deaths and ending extreme poverty. Under the PMI Strategy, the U.S. Government's goal is to work with PMI-supported countries and partners to further reduce malaria deaths and substantially decrease malaria morbidity, towards the long-term goal of elimination. More information can be found at www.pmi.gov.\r\n\r\nData created from this mapping effort will help Indoor Residual Spraying programs in Mozambique plan for the upcoming spray campaign as well as a program coordinated through the Local Peace Corps Volunteer to map heath related resources. After the base map is completed by remote mappers, Peace Corps Volunteers in Maputo Province will work with their Mozambican counterparts to complete Field Papers in key villages and towns and add local knowledge to OSM.\r\n\r\nThis data is intended to help PMI, PC, and community actors with project scope, spray planning, and community resources management. Specifically with IRS, teams apply insecticide to the walls of houses to kill mosquitoes which transmit malaria. These updated maps will help make smart choices on exactly where to spray, and improve spray team activities by providing project managers with improved estimates of the number of households and structures.","author":"Choquette33","per_task_instructions":"","last_update":"2016-06-30T09:53:35Z","priority":2,"done":2.17,"short_description":"The Peace Corps Public Health program in Mozambique is requesting assistance building a better base map of Maracuene.
