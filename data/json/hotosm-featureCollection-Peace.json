Please use the tags below, taken from the OpenStreetMap Wiki:\r\n\r\nTertiary Road: The roads interconnecting villages and the major streets in towns of some importance.\r\n\r\nResidential Road: The roads in residential areas except for major streets that interconnect with various roads (i.e. primary, secondary, tertiary).\r\n\r\nUnclassified Road: The roads serving for interconnection of smaller villages and hamlets.\r\n\r\nTrack: The small roads going outside the residential areas, mainly for agricultural and forestry purposes. In general these roads do not have a connecting function with other roads. \r\n\r\n*For more information, please visit: [http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Highway_Tag_Africa](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Highway_Tag_Africa)*\r\n"

Please use the tags below, taken from the OpenStreetMap Wiki:\r\n\r\nTertiary Road: The roads interconnecting villages and the major streets in towns of some importance.\r\n\r\nResidential Road: The roads in residential areas except for major streets that interconnect with various roads (i.e. primary, secondary, tertiary).\r\n\r\nUnclassified Road: The roads serving for interconnection of smaller villages and hamlets.\r\n\r\nTrack: The small roads going outside the residential areas, mainly for agricultural and forestry purposes. In general these roads do not have a connecting function with other roads. \r\n\r\n*For more information, please visit: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Highway_Tag_Africa.*\r\n"

A road typology should be based on the road importance and not on the surface or the visual appearance of the road”. --Highway Tag Africa, OpenStreetMap Wiki\r\n\r\nIt can be hard to know the economic and social role of a road, but we can guess that a road is important to trace if it connects other roads, clusters of buildings, or towns and villages. Please use the tags below, taken from the OpenStreetMap Wiki:\r\n\r\nTertiary Road: The roads interconnecting villages and the major streets in towns of some importance.\r\n\r\nResidential Road: The roads in residential areas except for major streets that interconnect with various roads (i.e. primary, secondary, tertiary).\r\n\r\nUnclassified Road: The roads serving for interconnection of smaller villages and hamlets.\r\n\r\nTrack: The small roads going outside the residential areas, mainly for agricultural and forestry purposes. In general these roads do not have a connecting function with other roads. \r\n\r\n*For more information, please visit: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Highway_Tag_Africa.*\r\n\r\nSave with credit to HOTOSM.

Please use the tags below, taken from the OpenStreetMap Wiki:\r\n\r\nTertiary Road: The roads interconnecting villages and the major streets in towns of some importance.\r\n\r\nResidential Road: The roads in residential areas except for major streets that interconnect with various roads (i.e. primary, secondary, tertiary).\r\n\r\nUnclassified Road: The roads serving for interconnection of smaller villages and hamlets.\r\n\r\nTrack: The small roads going outside the residential areas, mainly for agricultural and forestry purposes. In general these roads do not have a connecting function with other roads. \r\n\r\n*For more information, please visit: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Highway_Tag_Africa.*\r\n\r\nImagery Details\r\nThis imagery is from Digital Globe’s WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 satellite, and is made up of images taken on December 1st 2014, January 1st 2015, and January 4th 2015.

The Peace Corps Volunteers and the community will add their detailed local knowledge to the map after we complete the task.\r\n\r\nSquare the corners of all buildings by pressing “S” on your keyboard after labeling the building. You may see round huts; make your buildings perfectly round by pressing “O”.\r\n\r\n**Roads:**\r\n“The road conditions in Africa do not always correspond to their economic and social role. A road typology should be based on the road importance and not on the surface or the visual appearance of the road”. --Highway Tag Africa, OpenStreetMap Wiki\r\n\r\nIt can be hard to know the economic and social role of a road, but we can guess that a road is important to trace if it connects other roads, clusters of buildings, or towns and villages. Please use the tags below, taken from the OpenStreetMap Wiki:\r\n\r\nTertiary Road: The roads interconnecting villages and the major streets in towns of some importance.\r\n\r\nResidential Road: The roads in residential areas except for major streets that interconnect with various roads (i.e. primary, secondary, tertiary).\r\n\r\nUnclassified Road: The roads serving for interconnection of smaller villages and hamlets.\r\n\r\nTrack: The small roads going outside the residential areas, mainly for agricultural and forestry purposes. In general these roads do not have a connecting function with other roads. \r\n\r\n*For more information, please visit: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Highway_Tag_Africa.*\r\n"

A road typology should be based on the road importance and not on the surface or the visual appearance of the road”. --Highway Tag Africa, OpenStreetMap Wiki\r\n\r\nIt can be hard to know the economic and social role of a road, but we can guess that a road is important to trace if it connects other roads, clusters of buildings, or towns and villages. Please use the tags below, taken from the OpenStreetMap Wiki:\r\n\r\nTertiary Road: The roads interconnecting villages and the major streets in towns of some importance.\r\n\r\nResidential Road: The roads in residential areas except for major streets that interconnect with various roads (i.e. primary, secondary, tertiary).\r\n\r\nUnclassified Road: The roads serving for interconnection of smaller villages and hamlets.\r\n\r\nTrack: The small roads going outside the residential areas, mainly for agricultural and forestry purposes. In general these roads do not have a connecting function with other roads. \r\n\r\n*For more information, please visit: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Highway_Tag_Africa.*\r\n"

A road typology should be based on the road importance and not on the surface or the visual appearance of the road”. --Highway Tag Africa, OpenStreetMap Wiki\r\n\r\nIt can be hard to know the economic and social role of a road, but we can guess that a road is important to trace if it connects other roads, clusters of buildings, or towns and villages. Please use the tags below, taken from the OpenStreetMap Wiki:\r\n\r\nTertiary Road: The roads interconnecting villages and the major streets in towns of some importance.\r\n\r\nResidential Road: The roads in residential areas except for major streets that interconnect with various roads (i.e. primary, secondary, tertiary).\r\n\r\nUnclassified Road: The roads serving for interconnection of smaller villages and hamlets.\r\n\r\nTrack: The small roads going outside the residential areas, mainly for agricultural and forestry purposes. In general these roads do not have a connecting function with other roads. \r\n\r\n*For more information, please visit: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Highway_Tag_Africa.*\r\n"

The Peace Corps Volunteers and the community will add their detailed local knowledge to the map after we complete the task.\r\n\r\nSquare the corners of all buildings by pressing “S” on your keyboard after labeling the building. You may see round huts; make your buildings perfectly round by pressing “O”.\r\n\r\n**Roads:**\r\n“The road conditions in Africa do not always correspond to their economic and social role. A road typology should be based on the road importance and not on the surface or the visual appearance of the road”. --Highway Tag Africa, OpenStreetMap Wiki\r\n\r\nIt can be hard to know the economic and social role of a road, but we can guess that a road is important to trace if it connects other roads, clusters of buildings, or towns and villages. Please use the tags below, taken from the OpenStreetMap Wiki:\r\n\r\nTertiary Road: The roads interconnecting villages and the major streets in towns of some importance.\r\n\r\nResidential Road: The roads in residential areas except for major streets that interconnect with various roads (i.e. primary, secondary, tertiary).\r\n\r\nUnclassified Road: The roads serving for interconnection of smaller villages and hamlets.\r\n\r\nTrack: The small roads going outside the residential areas, mainly for agricultural and forestry purposes. In general these roads do not have a connecting function with other roads. \r\n\r\n*For more information, please visit: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Highway_Tag_Africa.*\r\n"

A road typology should be based on the road importance and not on the surface or the visual appearance of the road”. --Highway Tag Africa, OpenStreetMap Wiki\r\n\r\nIt can be hard to know the economic and social role of a road, but we can guess that a road is important to trace if it connects other roads, clusters of buildings, or towns and villages. Please use the tags below, taken from the OpenStreetMap Wiki:\r\n\r\nTertiary Road: The roads interconnecting villages and the major streets in towns of some importance.\r\n\r\nResidential Road: The roads in residential areas except for major streets that interconnect with various roads (i.e. primary, secondary, tertiary).\r\n\r\nUnclassified Road: The roads serving for interconnection of smaller villages and hamlets.\r\n\r\nTrack: The small roads going outside the residential areas, mainly for agricultural and forestry purposes. In general these roads do not have a connecting function with other roads. \r\n\r\n*For more information, please visit: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Highway_Tag_Africa.*"

A road typology should be based on the road importance and not on the surface or the visual appearance of the road”. --Highway Tag Africa, OpenStreetMap Wiki\r\n\r\nIt can be hard to know the economic and social role of a road, but we can guess that a road is important to trace if it connects other roads, clusters of buildings, or towns and villages. Please use the tags below, taken from the OpenStreetMap Wiki:\r\n\r\nTertiary Road: The roads interconnecting villages and the major streets in towns of some importance.\r\n\r\nResidential Road: The roads in residential areas except for major streets that interconnect with various roads (i.e. primary, secondary, tertiary).\r\n\r\nUnclassified Road: The roads serving for interconnection of smaller villages and hamlets.\r\n\r\nTrack: The small roads going outside the residential areas, mainly for agricultural and forestry purposes. In general these roads do not have a connecting function with other roads. \r\n\r\n*For more information, please visit: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Highway_Tag_Africa.*"

A road typology should be based on the road importance and not on the surface or the visual appearance of the road”. --Highway Tag Africa, OpenStreetMap Wiki\r\n\r\nIt can be hard to know the economic and social role of a road, but we can guess that a road is important to trace if it connects other roads, clusters of buildings, or towns and villages. Please use the tags below, taken from the OpenStreetMap Wiki:\r\n\r\nTertiary Road: The roads interconnecting villages and the major streets in towns of some importance.\r\n\r\nResidential Road: The roads in residential areas except for major streets that interconnect with various roads (i.e. primary, secondary, tertiary).\r\n\r\nUnclassified Road: The roads serving for interconnection of smaller villages and hamlets.\r\n\r\nTrack: The small roads going outside the residential areas, mainly for agricultural and forestry purposes. In general these roads do not have a connecting function with other roads. \r\n\r\n*For more information, please visit: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Highway_Tag_Africa.*\r\n"

You may see round huts; make your buildings perfectly round by pressing “O”.\r\n\r\n**Roads:**\r\n“The road conditions in Africa do not always correspond to their economic and social role. A road typology should be based on the road importance and not on the surface or the visual appearance of the road”. --Highway Tag Africa, OpenStreetMap Wiki\r\n\r\nIt can be hard to know the economic and social role of a road, but we can guess that a road is important to trace if it connects other roads, clusters of buildings, or towns and villages. Please use the tags below, taken from the OpenStreetMap Wiki:\r\n\r\nTertiary Road: The roads interconnecting villages and the major streets in towns of some importance.\r\n\r\nResidential Road: The roads in residential areas except for major streets that interconnect with various roads (i.e. primary, secondary, tertiary).\r\n\r\nUnclassified Road: The roads serving for interconnection of smaller villages and hamlets.\r\n\r\nTrack: The small roads going outside the residential areas, mainly for agricultural and forestry purposes. In general these roads do not have a connecting function with other roads. \r\n\r\n*For more information, please visit: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Highway_Tag_Africa.*\r\n\r\nThis imagery is from Digital Globe's WorldView-2 satellite, and was taken on May 27, 2015.

Additionally, the image has been contrast stretched using a custom stretch and processed into a Tiled Map Service (TMS) for performance."

Initially, the base map data will be used to conduct mapping exercises and geographic analysis in support of malaria prevention. Objectives include mapping malaria cases to better understand transmission trends and conduct contact tracing and mapping Indoor Residual Spraying campaigns. The organizations would also like to use the OSM data to monitor TB cases, optimize routing while providing care to home-based patients, and better allocate resources to orphans and vulnerable children.  Teams will be in the field conducting Field Papers in mid-March. ",

Comment the changeset with: *#hotosm-project-1486 #PeaceCorps #PCBotswana source=Bing*\r\n\r\n**Buildings:**\r\nPlease label all buildings as general buildings. The Peace Corps Volunteer and the community will add their detailed local knowledge to the map after we complete the task.\r\n\r\nSquare the corners of all buildings by pressing “S” on your keyboard after labeling the building. You may see huts in Botswana; make your buildings perfectly round by pressing “O”.\r\n\r\n**Compound Walls**\r\nUse the Line tool to trace walls. Label them by searching \"wall\" in the \"Search Features\" panel. \r\n\r\n**Roads:**\r\n“The road conditions in Africa do not always correspond to their economic and social role. A road typology should be based on the road importance and not on the surface or the visual appearance of the road”. --Highway Tag Africa, OpenStreetMap Wiki\r\n\r\nIt can be hard to know the economic and social role of a road, but we can guess that a road is important to trace if it connects other roads, clusters of buildings, or towns and villages. Please use the tags below, taken from the OpenStreetMap Wiki:\r\n\r\nTertiary Road: The roads interconnecting villages and the major streets in towns of some importance.\r\n\r\nResidential Road: The roads in residential areas except for major streets that interconnect with various roads (i.e. primary, secondary, tertiary).\r\n\r\nUnclassified Road: The roads serving for interconnection of smaller villages and hamlets.\r\n\r\nTrack: The small roads going outside the residential areas, mainly for agricultural and forestry purposes. In general these roads do not have a connecting function with other roads. \r\n\r\n*For more information, please visit: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Highway_Tag_Africa.*\r\n\r\n"

A road typology should be based on the road importance and not on the surface or the visual appearance of the road”. --Highway Tag Africa, OpenStreetMap Wiki\r\n\r\nIt can be hard to know the economic and social role of a road, but we can guess that a road is important to trace if it connects other roads, clusters of buildings, or towns and villages. Please use the tags below, taken from the OpenStreetMap Wiki:\r\n\r\nTertiary Road: The roads interconnecting villages and the major streets in towns of some importance.\r\n\r\nResidential Road: The roads in residential areas except for major streets that interconnect with various roads (i.e. primary, secondary, tertiary).\r\n\r\nUnclassified Road: The roads serving for interconnection of smaller villages and hamlets.\r\n\r\nTrack: The small roads going outside the residential areas, mainly for agricultural and forestry purposes. In general these roads do not have a connecting function with other roads. \r\n\r\n*For more information, please visit: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Highway_Tag_Africa.*\r\n"

The Peace Corps Volunteer and the community will add their detailed local knowledge to the map after we complete the task.\r\n\r\nSquare the corners of all buildings by pressing “S” on your keyboard after labeling the building. You may see huts in Botswana; make your buildings perfectly round by pressing “O”.\r\n\r\n**Compound Walls**\r\nUse the Line tool to trace walls. Label them by searching \"wall\" in the \"Search Features\" panel. \r\n\r\n**Roads:**\r\n“The road conditions in Africa do not always correspond to their economic and social role. A road typology should be based on the road importance and not on the surface or the visual appearance of the road”. --Highway Tag Africa, OpenStreetMap Wiki\r\n\r\nIt can be hard to know the economic and social role of a road, but we can guess that a road is important to trace if it connects other roads, clusters of buildings, or towns and villages. Please use the tags below, taken from the OpenStreetMap Wiki:\r\n\r\nTertiary Road: The roads interconnecting villages and the major streets in towns of some importance.\r\n\r\nResidential Road: The roads in residential areas except for major streets that interconnect with various roads (i.e. primary, secondary, tertiary).\r\n\r\nUnclassified Road: The roads serving for interconnection of smaller villages and hamlets.\r\n\r\nTrack: The small roads going outside the residential areas, mainly for agricultural and forestry purposes. In general these roads do not have a connecting function with other roads. \r\n\r\n*For more information, please visit: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Highway_Tag_Africa.*\r\n"

A road typology should be based on the road importance and not on the surface or the visual appearance of the road”. --Highway Tag Africa, OpenStreetMap Wiki\r\n\r\nIt can be hard to know the economic and social role of a road, but we can guess that a road is important to trace if it connects other roads, clusters of buildings, or towns and villages. Please use the tags below, taken from the OpenStreetMap Wiki:\r\n\r\nTertiary Road: The roads interconnecting villages and the major streets in towns of some importance.\r\n\r\nResidential Road: The roads in residential areas except for major streets that interconnect with various roads (i.e. primary, secondary, tertiary).\r\n\r\nUnclassified Road: The roads serving for interconnection of smaller villages and hamlets.\r\n\r\nTrack: The small roads going outside the residential areas, mainly for agricultural and forestry purposes. In general these roads do not have a connecting function with other roads. \r\n\r\n*For more information, please visit: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Highway_Tag_Africa.*\r\n"

It is difficult to reach all of Mochudi's population, which is nearly 45,000 with HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention programs. With the help of OpenStreetMap, the District AIDS Office along with the District Health Management Team, plans to map the entirety of Mochudi, and later all of Kgatleng District. Upon completion of the map these organizations will be able to better analyze areas with high rates of HIV/AIDS. The District Health Management Team also plans to use OSM and geospatial data to improve operations of its TB, HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infection clinics.",

A road typology should be based on the road importance and not on the surface or the visual appearance of the road”. --Highway Tag Africa, OpenStreetMap Wiki\r\n\r\nIt can be hard to know the economic and social role of a road, but we can guess that a road is important to trace if it connects other roads, clusters of buildings, or towns and villages. Please use the tags below, taken from the OpenStreetMap Wiki:\r\n\r\nTertiary Road: The roads interconnecting villages and the major streets in towns of some importance.\r\n\r\nResidential Road: The roads in residential areas except for major streets that interconnect with various roads (i.e. primary, secondary, tertiary).\r\n\r\nUnclassified Road: The roads serving for interconnection of smaller villages and hamlets.\r\n\r\nTrack: The small roads going outside the residential areas, mainly for agricultural and forestry purposes. In general these roads do not have a connecting function with other roads. \r\n\r\n*For more information, please visit: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Highway_Tag_Africa.*\r\n"

Please use the tags below, taken from the OpenStreetMap Wiki:\r\n\r\nTertiary Road: The roads interconnecting villages and the major streets in towns of some importance.\r\n\r\nResidential Road: The roads in residential areas except for major streets that interconnect with various roads (i.e. primary, secondary, tertiary).\r\n\r\nUnclassified Road: The roads serving for interconnection of smaller villages and hamlets.\r\n\r\nTrack: The small roads going outside the residential areas, mainly for agricultural and forestry purposes. In general these roads do not have a connecting function with other roads. \r\n\r\n*For more information, please visit: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Highway_Tag_Africa.*\r\n"

        "description": "Peace Corps Volunteers in Mozambique are working to promote map literacy, improve local health center catchment, and educating on the importance of maps in understanding existing and needed resources for community development. In Marracuene District specifically, Peace Corps is supporting local counterparts in conducting epidemiological tracking of malarial cases to advocate need for stronger preventative measures, which an up-to-date base map plays an integral role. Malaria prevention and control remains a major U.S. foreign assistance objective and PMI's Strategy fully aligns with the U.S. Government's vision of ending preventable child and maternal deaths and ending extreme poverty. Under the PMI Strategy, the U.S. Government's goal is to work with PMI-supported countries and partners to further reduce malaria deaths and substantially decrease malaria morbidity, towards the long-term goal of elimination. More information can be found at www.pmi.gov.\r\n\r\nData created from this mapping effort will help Indoor Residual Spraying programs in Mozambique plan for the upcoming spray campaign as well as a program coordinated through the Local Peace Corps Volunteer to map heath related resources. After the base map is completed by remote mappers, Peace Corps Volunteers in Maputo Province will work with their Mozambican counterparts to complete Field Papers in key villages and towns and add local knowledge to OSM.\r\n\r\nThis data is intended to help PMI, PC, and community actors with project scope, spray planning, and community resources management. Specifically with IRS, teams apply insecticide to the walls of houses to kill mosquitoes which transmit malaria. These updated maps will help make smart choices on exactly where to spray, and improve spray team activities by providing project managers with improved estimates of the number of households and structures.",

A road typology should be based on the road importance and not on the surface or the visual appearance of the road”. --Highway Tag Africa, OpenStreetMap Wiki\r\n\r\nIt can be hard to know the economic and social role of a road, but we can guess that a road is important to trace if it connects other roads, clusters of buildings, or towns and villages. Please use the tags below, taken from the OpenStreetMap Wiki:\r\n\r\nTertiary Road: The roads interconnecting villages and the major streets in towns of some importance.\r\n\r\nResidential Road: The roads in residential areas except for major streets that interconnect with various roads (i.e. primary, secondary, tertiary).\r\n\r\nUnclassified Road: The roads serving for interconnection of smaller villages and hamlets.\r\n\r\nTrack: The small roads going outside the residential areas, mainly for agricultural and forestry purposes. In general these roads do not have a connecting function with other roads. \r\n\r\n*For more information, please visit: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Highway_Tag_Africa.*"

The Peace Corps Volunteer and the community will add their detailed local knowledge to the map after we complete the task.\r\n\r\nSquare the corners of all buildings by pressing “S” on your keyboard after labeling the building. You may see huts; make your buildings perfectly round by pressing “O”.\r\n\r\n**Compound Walls**\r\nUse the Line tool to trace walls. Label them by searching \"wall\" in the \"Search Features\" panel. \r\n\r\n**Roads:**\r\n“The road conditions in Africa do not always correspond to their economic and social role. A road typology should be based on the road importance and not on the surface or the visual appearance of the road”. --Highway Tag Africa, OpenStreetMap Wiki\r\n\r\nIt can be hard to know the economic and social role of a road, but we can guess that a road is important to trace if it connects other roads, clusters of buildings, or towns and villages. Please use the tags below, taken from the OpenStreetMap Wiki:\r\n\r\nTertiary Road: The roads interconnecting villages and the major streets in towns of some importance.\r\n\r\nResidential Road: The roads in residential areas except for major streets that interconnect with various roads (i.e. primary, secondary, tertiary).\r\n\r\nUnclassified Road: The roads serving for interconnection of smaller villages and hamlets.\r\n\r\nTrack: The small roads going outside the residential areas, mainly for agricultural and forestry purposes. In general these roads do not have a connecting function with other roads. \r\n\r\n*For more information, please visit: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Highway_Tag_Africa.*\r\n"

A road typology should be based on the road importance and not on the surface or the visual appearance of the road”. --Highway Tag Africa, OpenStreetMap Wiki\r\n\r\nIt can be hard to know the economic and social role of a road, but we can guess that a road is important to trace if it connects other roads, clusters of buildings, or towns and villages. Please use the tags below, taken from the OpenStreetMap Wiki:\r\n\r\nTertiary Road: The roads interconnecting villages and the major streets in towns of some importance.\r\n\r\nResidential Road: The roads in residential areas except for major streets that interconnect with various roads (i.e. primary, secondary, tertiary).\r\n\r\nUnclassified Road: The roads serving for interconnection of smaller villages and hamlets.\r\n\r\nTrack: The small roads going outside the residential areas, mainly for agricultural and forestry purposes. In general these roads do not have a connecting function with other roads. \r\n\r\n*For more information, please visit: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Highway_Tag_Africa.*\r\n\r\nImagery Details\r\n\r\nThis imagery is from DigitalGlobe’s WorldView-3 satellite, and is made up an image taken on May, 10th 2016.

A road typology should be based on the road importance and not on the surface or the visual appearance of the road”. --Highway Tag Africa, OpenStreetMap Wiki\r\n\r\nIt can be hard to know the economic and social role of a road, but we can guess that a road is important to trace if it connects other roads, clusters of buildings, or towns and villages. Please use the tags below, taken from the OpenStreetMap Wiki:\r\n\r\nTertiary Road: The roads interconnecting villages and the major streets in towns of some importance.\r\n\r\nResidential Road: The roads in residential areas except for major streets that interconnect with various roads (i.e. primary, secondary, tertiary).\r\n\r\nUnclassified Road: The roads serving for interconnection of smaller villages and hamlets.\r\n\r\nTrack: The small roads going outside the residential areas, mainly for agricultural and forestry purposes. In general these roads do not have a connecting function with other roads. \r\n\r\n*For more information, please visit: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Highway_Tag_Africa.*\r\n"

A road typology should be based on the road importance and not on the surface or the visual appearance of the road”. --Highway Tag Africa, OpenStreetMap Wiki\r\n\r\nIt can be hard to know the economic and social role of a road, but we can guess that a road is important to trace if it connects other roads, clusters of buildings, or towns and villages. Please use the tags below, taken from the OpenStreetMap Wiki:\r\n\r\nTertiary Road: The roads interconnecting villages and the major streets in towns of some importance.\r\n\r\nResidential Road: The roads in residential areas except for major streets that interconnect with various roads (i.e. primary, secondary, tertiary).\r\n\r\nUnclassified Road: The roads serving for interconnection of smaller villages and hamlets.\r\n\r\nTrack: The small roads going outside the residential areas, mainly for agricultural and forestry purposes. In general these roads do not have a connecting function with other roads. \r\n\r\n*For more information, please visit: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Highway_Tag_Africa.*\r\n"

A road typology should be based on the road importance and not on the surface or the visual appearance of the road”. --Highway Tag Africa, OpenStreetMap Wiki\r\n\r\nIt can be hard to know the economic and social role of a road, but we can guess that a road is important to trace if it connects other roads, clusters of buildings, or towns and villages. Please use the tags below, taken from the OpenStreetMap Wiki:\r\n\r\nTertiary Road: The roads interconnecting villages and the major streets in towns of some importance.\r\n\r\nResidential Road: The roads in residential areas except for major streets that interconnect with various roads (i.e. primary, secondary, tertiary).\r\n\r\nUnclassified Road: The roads serving for interconnection of smaller villages and hamlets.\r\n\r\nTrack: The small roads going outside the residential areas, mainly for agricultural and forestry purposes. In general these roads do not have a connecting function with other roads. \r\n\r\n*For more information, please visit: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Highway_Tag_Africa.*\r\n"
